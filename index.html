    <h2>What is Css?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Css stands cascading style sheets</li>
        <li>Css descibes how HTML elements are to be displayed screen,paper, or in other media</li>
        <li><span class = "text">Css is  not necessary</span>.<span class ="style">Css saves a lot work.</span> It can be control the layout multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li class="italic">External style sheets are stored in css files</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="head">CSS can be added to be HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
 <ul>
     <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside the html documents</li>
     <li>Internal- by using the style element in the header section</li>
     <li>External- by using the link element to link to an external CSS files</li>
     <li>The most common ways to ass css,is to be kept the styles in external Css files.<span style ="background-color:yellow;font-weight: bolder ;">however in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
 </ul>
 <p>when comparing the CSS vs ID,the differnce is that css class applied a style to multiple elements.ID on the other hand.applies a style to one unique element.Id is also special that you can a special url to link directly to an element and its used by Javascript  </p>
 <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific elelment ona web page .Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can applied to the element </p>
 <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used as a class and id.Both are used to target the elements to which style should be applied </p>
